# Project 2 
Presentations: August 1st, 2022 (Monday)
-	You will be working in small groups to create an application of your choice.
-	This application should have multiple user roles, CRUD functionality, an external API, and implement the following technology stack:

Java, AWS RDS, CI/CD pipeline (EC2, Maven, Jenkins, GitHub), Spring Data and Spring MVC or Spring Boot, Angular, Bootstrap.
Logging with Log4J, unit testing with JUnit (Maven can automate this as a build step).

### Past Examples:

-	Suggestion of ailment based on symptoms
-	Music based social network application

-	Pull requests must be made for each merge and approved by a teammate.
-	Do not change more than 5-7 files in a pull request.
